Usage
=====

For a detailed usage guide, please refer to the Jupyter notebook linked below:

- `Colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Oa7qmHEDdP5NjGOp-73_JBS1Kc5394Yx?usp=sharing>`_

This python Notebook shows an exemplary usage of the up-ac module. 
In particular, this notebook will go through an example of Algorithm Configuration for ENHSP, an Expressive Numeric Heuristic Search Planner. 
For this, we use SMAC, a Sequential Model-Based Optimization for General Algorithm Configuration.

Generic configuration tools
------------------

Within this project there are also some generic configuration tools, which can be used as a base to implement other configuration tools of choice.
More information on these can be found in the :ref:`genFunc` section.
